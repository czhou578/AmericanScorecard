# Whitehouse.gov 2025 (Andrew Yang Site)
This was a website that I made to imagine what a potential whitehouse.gov website would look like if Andrew Yang won
the presidency and became President of the United States. It also contains resources that can help you find the closest
elections near you, and also tracks the finances of electoral candidates.

It is hosted using Firebase. Enjoy!
